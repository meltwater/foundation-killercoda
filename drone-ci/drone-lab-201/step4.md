With the Drone Server running we can now continue showing a UI-based activation of a repository:

1. Navigate to [drone ui]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_30080}})
   * You may have to click 'authorize application' if it is your first time logging into drone
   * You may also land on a 'Complete your registration' page that asks for some info, just click 'Submit'
2. If the repo you created in the last step is not visible, click the 'Sync' button (top right)
3. If your repo is already visible, choose it from the repository listing
4. Click 'Activate Repository' button

Now your repo is activated and ready to configure a pipeline!

> **NOTE**:
> You might want to take a few moments and look around at the options available, but don't take too long or the session may timeout :-)
