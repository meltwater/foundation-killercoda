### Create `index.html`{{}}

Open the `~/class/index.html`{{}} file using the editor tab, then copy and paste / modify as desired:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Space</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <pre>
      Hello ___________, have a whale of a good time!
    </pre>
  </body>
</html>
```{{copy}}

Now that you have it modified to your liking, lets build some checks to test the HTML code that has been added to the index.html file.
