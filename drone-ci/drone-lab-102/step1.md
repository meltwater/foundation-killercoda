### Create `index.html`

Open the `/class/index.html` file using the katacoda editor (top right panel), then copy and paste / modify as desired:
```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Space</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <pre>
      Hello ___________, have a whale of a good time!
    </pre>
  </body>
</html>
â€‹```{{copy}}

Now that you have it modified to your liking, lets build some checks to test the HTML code that has been added to the index.html file.
